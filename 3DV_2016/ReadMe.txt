This README file contains the information you will need to 
access the electronic guide, file START.PDF, located on 
the root directory. This guide acts as the main menu by 
providing the hypertext links to view, navigate, search, 
download, and print all data on the disk.

IMPORTANT NOTE: To keep documents from closing after going to the 
pdf file, go to Edit Menu, Preferences, General. There should 
be no checkmark next to "open cross-document links in same
window."

Section 1. Software Requirements
Adobe Acrobat Reader 7 
==========================================================

To browse the files on this CD-ROM, you will need to have 
Adobe Acrobat Reader 6 or 7 installed. In order to 
take full advantage of the CD-ROM's capabilities, we 
recommend using a version that includes the "Search" plug-
in which enables full-text searches across documents 
contained on this disk. "Search" is included in the Adobe 
Acrobat Reader 7 installation on this CD.

VERIFICATION FOR "SEARCH"

If you already have Acrobat Reader installed on your 
system, and you would like to maximize the usefulness of 
this CD-ROM, you will want to verify that you have the 
"Search" plug-in installed. This can be accomplished by 
launching Reader and checking either the Acrobat Reader 
Toolbar for the "Search" icon (binoculars with a piece of 
paper in the background) or by dropping down the Edit menu 
and looking for the "Search" menu item. If these options 
exist, "Search" is installed. If you do not have these 
options, you may want to proceed with one of the following:

1. Go to Adobe's website, www.adobe.com, to see if "Search" 
is available for your version of Reader. If it is, install 
according to their instructions.
2. Install Acrobat Reader from this CD according to the 
instructions in the next section of this README. "Search" 
will automatically be installed with Adobe Acrobat Reader 7.
3. Use this CD without having "Search" capabilities.

==========================================================
Section 3. CD-ROM Information
==========================================================

This material was published using Adobe(TM) Acrobat(TM) 
technology to create portable document format (PDF) files. 

This CD-ROM is a hybrid structure which allows Windows, 
Macintosh(R), and UNIX(R) users to share the same directory 
structure and access common files. Included are versions of 
Acrobat Reader 7 with Search for Microsoft Windows(R) (95, 
98, NT, Millenium, and Windows 2000), and Apple Macintosh 
with System 8.6 or greater. Acrobat 4 or 5 for UNIX [for Sun(R), 
HP, Silicon Graphics(R), Dec Alpha, and IBM AIX(R)].  

-----------------------------------------------------------
Optical Character Recognition
-----------------------------------------------------------
The PDFs contained on this CD-ROM were created using 
Acrobat Capture search technology, either by scanning 
printed pages or by converting electronic files. In the 
scanning process, the actual printed pages of the 
documentation are scanned to create both an image of each 
page as well as optical character recognition (OCR) data. 
What you see on your computer monitor or on the page that 
you print through Acrobat Reader is a rendering of the 
image, while the OCR data is used behind the scenes for 
search purposes. 

Since some images may have been generated from printed 
pages, the quality may not be as good as when input is from 
digital sources. In many cases, greater than 100 percent 
magnification is required to read documents online. Pages 
printed at 100 percent magnification are easy to read, 
however. Image quality will also vary depending on the 
resolution of your monitor. To improve the quality of the 
image, try activating the option Smooth text and Smooth 
Images found in the Acrobat Reader under the
Edit/Preferences/Display menu. Note: This may affect screen 
refresh speed. See the Troubleshooting section.

The accuracy of the image on your screen or of the printed 
page should mirror the accuracy of the original page. When 
you conduct full-text searches, however, the results will 
vary. Characters that are not recognized successfully 
during the OCR process are bitmapped, and words containing 
such characters cannot be searched successfully. They also 
cannot be copied and printed into word processing software 
pages without some loss of data.


==========================================================
Section 4. Using Features
==========================================================

We recommend viewing the Getting Started section provided 
in START.PDF to familiarize yourself with the navigation 
and tools used by the electronic guide and Acrobat Reader. 
In addition, the Acrobat Reader Online Guide also provides 
essential information.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Navigating
-----------------------------------------------------------

When viewing an article, there are three methods of 
returning to the electronic guide.

* Select Document/Go To Previous Document on the menu 
bar 
* Click (as needed) on the Previous View button located on 
the Acrobat tool bar. 
* Use the File selection on the menu bar 
(File/START.PDF).

-----------------------------------------------------------
Searching
-----------------------------------------------------------

To learn about the full capabilities of this Search tool, 
please reference the Online guide. This can be accessed via
Help/Reader Help.

RECOMMENDATION:
Turn ON the Show Document Information option under 
Edit/Preferences/Search. This allows the Title, Author, 
Keywords, and Subject fields to be visible when specifying 
search criteria. You may also want to increase the number 
of hits by changing the Show First 100 (default) documents
to 1000.


==========================================================
Section 5. Troubleshooting
==========================================================

Q:  When I print a document, some of the text is cut off.

A:  Select Shrink oversized papers to paper size under 
File/Print. This will capture the entire image on to your 
print out.

Q:  When I closed the file I was viewing, the Guide file 
was also closed and I had to reopen it.

A:  Instead of closing the file, use Document/Go To
Previous Document to return to the electronic guide file. 
See Navigating section above.

Q:  Screen refresh and printing takes an extraordinarily 
long time on my system.

A:  Under Edit/Preferences/Display, turn off the options for 
Smooth Text & Smooth Images.

Q:  When I open the file for the guide, I only get part of 
the opening image. For example, I see bookmarks on the left 
hand side of the screen, but nothing on the right.

A:  You may be using an earlier version of Adobe Acrobat 
Reader. Install Adobe Acrobat Reader 7 with Search from 
this CD (see Section 2. Installation Instructions).

Q: (Macintosh users) When I do a search, I get a message "An 
internal error has occurred. Can't retrieve the results. 
Sorry."

A: This is a known Adobe problem. It occurs when a search is 
conducted on a group of files in which the first 64 
characters of some titles are identical. Please see 
Help/Reader Help/Searching Catalog Indexes to narrow the 
search parameters and avoid this from happening.
